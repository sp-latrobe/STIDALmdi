# STIDALmdi
Index number decomposition analysis (IDA) is a popular tool to analyse the drivers of energy and environmental indicators. Its popularity stems from the ability to disentangle different contributions of underlying factors on an aggregate measure. As such, a large body of research has developed and refined the methods. In recent times the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) methods have become the preferred method for implementing index number decomposition. The ST-IDA method is an integrated approach capturing spatial and temporal differences simultaneously. This method provides direct linkages between spatial units and temporal movements. This package implements these approaches in R. Installation.
